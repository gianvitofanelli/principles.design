title: Principles of Calm Technology
author: Amber Case
overview: |
    Our world is made of information that competes for our attention.
    What is necessary? What is not?

    When we design products, we aim to choose the best position for user interface components, placing the most important ones in the most accessible places on the screen.

    Equally important is the design of communication. How many notifications are necessary? How and when should they be displayed? To answer this, we can be inspired by the principles of calm technology.

 summary: |
    #Does your product need to rely on voice, or can it use a different communication method?#
    #Consider how your technology communicates status.#
 - principle: Technology should work even when it fails
  summary: |
    #Think about what happens if your technology fails.#
    #Does it default to a usable state or does it break down completely?#

  summary: |
    #What is the minimum amount of technology needed to solve the problem?#

 - principle: Technology should respect social norms
   summary: |
    #Technology takes time to introduce to humanity.#
    #What social norms exist that your technology might violate or cause stress on?#
    #Slowly introduce features so that people have time to get accustomed to the product.#
